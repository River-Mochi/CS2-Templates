#=================================================================
# Mini Commands throughout the day (Git Bash)
# version 0.1.1
#   - Save work (VS2026 Save)
#   - Commit checkpoints (safe vs pc crashes)
#   - Push to GitHub (backup vs PC loss)
#   - Swap real branch names for "wip/my-topic" below
#=================================================================

# 0) Start work (safe - fresh branch from remote Alpha)
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"       # SAFE: go to repo root
git fetch origin --prune                    # SAFE: update what .git knows about GitHub
git switch Alpha-v0.6.1                     # SAFE: switch branch
git pull --ff-only origin Alpha-v0.6.1      # CHANGE: update local Alpha (no auto-merge allowed)
git switch -c wip/my-topic                  # CHANGE: create + switch to new work branch

# 1) Edit files in VS2026 like normal
#    - File > Save often (saves to disk, NOT to git history)

# 2) Stage everything changed, commit (at good stopping points)
git status                                # List changed files
git add -A                                # Stage all branch changes
git status                                # Optional: recheck “Changes to be committed”
git commit -m "fix: changes"              # CHANGE: writes commit into local .git

# Repeat as needed all day:
git add -A								  # some time later
git commit -m "fix: more changes"	
	  
#... time passes, more edits
# side note:  VS GUI does both the add+commit together (like this)
git add -A								  # stage
git commit -m "docs: update Publish doc"  # commit

# Optional 1: only want ONE file (not all commited)
git status
git add Code/MoveIt/Mod.cs                # Stages ONLY this file
git commit -m "fix: register LocalePL in Mod.cs"  

# Optional: OOPS if you staged the wrong thing in Optional 1 (safe-ish, it's just staging)
# If you always "commit everything" (like VS "Commit All") and don’t mind extra files in commits,
# you can skip this.
# git restore --staged Code/MoveIt/Mod.cs   # Fix Oops or don't bother if you are ok keeping all commits. (I don't use restore)

# 3) Push to GitHub (backup); only first push needs (-u)
git push -u origin wip/my-topic   # Updates GitHub

# Later pushes (only works if you are ON the branch you mean to push):
git branch --show-current        # Safety: confirm you are on the branch you mean to push
git push                         # Pushes "current" branch to its tracked remote

# Can always do "git push origin wip/my-topic" full to be 100% sure. use TAB to autocomplete long names.

#3.2  Submit PR to Github, details: https://github.com/River-Mochi/CS2-Templates/blob/main/docs/GitHelp/git-WorkFlowLocal2PR.txt#L134

# 4) Cleanup after PR merged.
git switch Alpha-v0.6.1
git pull --ff-only origin Alpha-v0.6.1	# Make local Alpha exactly like Github
git branch -d wip/my-topic			    # Delete local branch
git push origin --delete wip/my-topic   # Delete remote branch ON Github or git-bash (ok to get error if it's already deleted)
git fetch origin --prune		        # tell local .git about changes

Note: I don't use stash and just use vs2026 saves and use "commit -m" a lot.
Push frequency is personal per how much work one is willing to lose if PC explodes.

# Quick glossary
# - VS Save: writes to disk only (it's Not in git history)
# - Commit: 
#     - local real saved checkpoint inside local .git (survives VS crash)
# - Push: sends commits to GitHub (survives PC total loss)
#     - now your commit history/blame is visible to all.
# - Stash: 
      - temporary "hide my uncommitted changes" (stored in .git).
	  - personal, team doesn't see (local).
	  - problem: easy to forget you stashed stuff (used sparingly).
	  - helps when you must switch branches NOW, but not ready for commit.
