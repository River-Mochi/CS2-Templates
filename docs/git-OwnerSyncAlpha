# Sync LOCAL Alpha-v0.6.1 to match GitHub (origin/Alpha-v0.6.1) as the repo owner.
# "origin" = yenyang/CS2-MoveIt (for forkers, it's canonical "upstream" repo).
# note: if someone has a fork and not owner, commands are different.
# remote = things on Github and not local vs2026 repo (local .git folder is important, don't delete)

# 0) Must be clean first (STOP if not clean; stash/commit before proceeding)
git status
# If needed to save local edits:
# git stash push -u -m "WIP before syncing Alpha-v0.6.1"

# 1) Update origin refs from GitHub (safe)
git fetch origin --prune

# 2) Switch to Alpha locally (STOP if it warns about overwriting local changes)
git switch Alpha-v0.6.1
# If branch doesn't exist locally:
# git switch -c Alpha-v0.6.1 --track origin/Alpha-v0.6.1

# 3) Fast-forward local to GitHub version (STOP if --ff-only fails; it means local has commits GitHub doesn’t)

git pull --ff-only origin Alpha-v0.6.1

# 4) If step 3 FAILED and the goal is "make local identical to GitHub anyway" you can do HARD reset:
#    (STOP and think: this discards local-only commits; make a backup branch first)

git branch backup/Alpha-v0.6.1-local-before-reset
git reset --hard origin/Alpha-v0.6.1

# 5) Verify (expect 0 0; STOP if not 0 0 because local still differs from GitHub)
